    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look specifically at preliminary notions of fairness applied to decision making systems powered by a supervised classifier. We begin with *observational* criteria: measurement of what exists and is observable. Observational criteria, like identifying differences the distribution of salaries between men and women, don't assert anything meaningful about the nature of the discrepancy, about *why* such differences exist, or whether they constitute discrimination. On the other hand, identifying such differences is a first step in surfacing *possible* inequities and understanding why they exist (e.g. via a causal investigation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will focus on allocative algorithmic decision made by a supervised, binary classifier. Such a context provides a simple, yet important, example to begin understanding these ideas. Much of this perspective follows Chapter 2 of {cite}`barocas-hardt-narayanan`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We fix notation for this context, which will be used in the remainder of the chapter: \n",
    "* the observed characteristics of an individual (variables) be denoted by $X$, \n",
    "* a category containing a salient group (e.g. race) specified by $A$,\n",
    "* the binary outcome variable denoted $Y$,\n",
    "* the decision making classifier $C(X,A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how each of these are depend on human choice and hide the complex, dirty, processes of measurement and interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start by first focusing on notion of the average quality of a classifier and examine properties of common metrics for classifiers in machine learning. On their own, these measures give us tools to pose questions about notions of *sufficiency* (as a concept in opposition to equality). \n",
    "* The next section will discuss *parity measures*, which quantify notions of equality we discussed before.\n",
    "* We then will revisit the tradeoff between maximizing aggregate utility and maintaining equality among groups\n",
    "* Lastly, we will look at ways these parity measures affect different steps of the modeling pipeline. \n"

Here, $X$ is the COMPAS survey and the defendant's criminal history, $A$ is race/ethnicity, $Y$ is whether individual will re-offend, a $C(X, A)$ decides if the defendant should be denied (1) or given (0) pretrial release.\n",

    "* TPR is the proportion of those who would have re-offended that were (correctly) denied release,\n",
    "* FPR is the proportion of those who would not have re-offended, but were unnecessarily kept in custody,\n",
    "* FNR is the proportion of those who would would have re-offended, who were released.\n",
    "* PPV is the proportion of those denied release that would have actually re-offended.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the last lecture, false positives and false negatives are qualitatively very different, making accuracy an inappropriate measure for algorithm quality. When is accuracy appropriate? When the false positives and false negatives have similar interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lending Decisions** Suppose you are a bank that must decide to make a loan to individuals. Here $X$ is an individual financial history, $A$ is any legally protected salient group, $Y$ is whether a loan would be paid back, and $C(X,A)$ decides if the bank should make the loan (1) or not (0). Unlike the Bail Decisions case, the positive category is a *good* outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hiring or Admissions Decisions** Suppose you are a university making decisions on which students to accept to their program. Here $X$ is the applicants academic record, $A$ is an legally protected salient group, $Y$ represents whether the applicant would be successful in the program, and $C(X,A)$ decides whether to admit (1) or reject (0) an applicant.

A program may instead use such an algorithm to *rank* applicants, so that they can select from the most highly ranked students. We will look at this (very similar case) later.\n",

    "**Gender Shades** Suppose an algorithm attempts to classify the identified gender of a person from an image. While there are many potential problems with such algorithms, they exist for a variety of reasons. For example, identifying the proportion of women displayed in the result of a Google image search may require using such an algorithm. Here $X$ is a picture of a person, $A$ is race, $Y$ is whether the person identifies as a woman, and $C(X, A)$ decides if a given image represents a woman (1) or not (0). \n",

    "*Note* that those this $Y$ is commonly used, it's not a well-defined binary outcome that every individual conforms to. In fact, forcing such categorization onto individuals has broad, lasting negative impacts. This case is meant to surface this problem and how it can more severly impact people of color. See [Gender Shades](http://gendershades.org/overview.html) for a more detailed story.\n",

    "* This condition doesn't say anything about the quality of the predictions for each group. In fact, imposing demographic parity improperly may hide harmful impacts. For example, if an admissions classifier admits the majority group systematically, but randomly admits minority applicants, the impact would be a lower graduation rate for minority students at the expense of minority students who may be more successful in the program.\n",

In the case of COMPAS, accuracy parity was approximately satisfied; the algorithm makes up for detaining releasable Black defendants by wrongly releasing white defendants. Accuracy parity is appropriate when the impacts of false positives and false negatives are similar. \n",

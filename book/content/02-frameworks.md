# What is Fairness?

Comment on practical perspective.
Terms: fairness, bias, discrimination, equality, equity, justice...

Want a brief summary to help frame discussion. Many of these are
discussed more elsewhere. This will largely be definitions.

Much of the ML decision making (though not all!) approaches allocation
of scarce resources.

## Utilitarianism

This is what ML models do. Classification + average performance
...

## Distributive Justice

### Equality of Opportunity

### Equality of Fair Opportunity

### Egalitarianism

## Discrimination

## Representational Harms

All of the above assert something about summing up a utility over some
space of possibilities. This can be included in that.

Political and Social systems must be in place for discrimination and
'unfair distribution'. How that distribution is systematically unfair
comes from these systems. Representation of people in the public
sphere sets up popular support for beliefs that enable such unfair
distribution.

Example: The prescriptive stereotype that women aren't as capable with
careers => lead to resource allocation for women staying home / men at
work.
